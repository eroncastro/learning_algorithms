Leaves - nodes without any child
Connections - edge

Height of a node - number of edges between it and the furthest leaf on the tree

Height of a tree = Height of the root node

Depth of a node - number of edges through the root

DFS - Depth-first search - visit all children first
Breadth-first search - visit all nodes on the same level first
